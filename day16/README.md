# Day 16 AI Study Project

This project contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks related to machine learning concepts.

## Files

*   `main.py`: Main Python script.
*   `cluster _learn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for learning about clustering algorithms.
*   `regression_learn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for learning about regression models.
*   `gradient_down_learn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for learning about gradient descent optimization.
*   `logic_regression_learn.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for learning about logistic regression.

## Usage

Each `.ipynb` file can be opened and run in a Jupyter Notebook environment to explore the specific machine learning concept it covers.
