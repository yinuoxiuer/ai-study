# Day 8 Study Project

This project contains Python code examples related to data structures and sorting algorithms.

## Contents

*   `二叉树.py`: Implementation of a Binary Tree, including node creation, level-order building, and various traversal methods (pre-order, in-order, level-order).
*   `排序.py`: Implementation and examples of different sorting algorithms, such as Quick Sort.
*   `sort与sorted.py`: Examples demonstrating the usage and differences between Python's built-in `sort()` method and the `sorted()` function. This includes advanced sorting with `key`, `lambda`, `itemgetter`, and `attrgetter`.
